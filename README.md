##### Why?

Because Skype native client for Linux sucks a lot.

unix-based systems.

`git clone https://github.com/haskellcamargo/skype-unofficial-client.git`

`sudo make linux_x86` or `sudo make linux_x64`

Run the application by `/opt/skype_unofficial_client/skype` or through
searching for "Skype" in the main menu.
